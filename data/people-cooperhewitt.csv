"Fortunato Pio Castellani (1794-1865) was a Roman Antique dealer, jeweler and goldsmith who was the most significant influence on Victorian jewelry and is credited as the pioneer of the Greek and Etruscan classical revival in the early 1860s, better known as the archaeological revival style of jewelry.  This style was extremely popular in both Europe and America.  Fascinated by the jewels of antiquity, he studied the style and techniques of ancient Etruscan (western Tuscany) goldsmiths who had attained technical perfection during the 7th to 5th centuries BC.  The styles contained gold granulation and filigree and included decorative motifs such as rosettes, urns and amphora.

The Castellani family, Fortunato in collaboration iwth his two sons Allesandro and Augusto, was responsible for jewelry's return to antiquity and resulting archaeoligical revival style dominating the mid nineteenth century.

Castellani displayed his new creations at the world's Great Exhibitions:  Florence (1861), London (1867 & 1878), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876) and Turin (1884).

"John Henry Belter (1804-1863) was a German-American cabinet maker. The John Henry Belter and Company Cabinet Factory was founded in 1858 on East 76th Street at 3rd Avenue in New York. The business opened in 1849 and closed in 1867. Because of the small size of his workshop, Belter is also considered the manufacturer of all of his furniture.
Influenced by the designs of John Jelliff (1813-1893), cabinetmakers (worked primarily with hand-crafted chair and sofa crests); archives at the Newark Museum. Belter's choice of rosewood for his chairs has been attributed to the Biedermeier period.",1,"American, b.

"Father of Piero Zen, Italian furniture designer, Carlo Zen was active in Milan, Italy.  He was both an Italian cabinetmaker and the owner of the largest furniture workshop in turn of the century Milan.  Zen was known for his furniture produced in ""Stilo Floreale,"" a combination of Art Noveau, Symbolist, and eclectic motifs.  Although he was a factory manager and not a designer per se, his firm was associated with the Haas of Vienna, thus adopting similar asymmetrical patterns and later geometric forms in furniture design.  The most renowned work of his factory was exhibited at the 1902 Exhibition of International Decorative Arts in Turin, Italy.",2,1851 – 1918,/m/02v_jff,18537909,,,6559,Carlo Zen,,0,0,9054,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537909/,,,12330197,23424853

Educated at the Otsuka Textile Design Institute, Takahashi has also studied and apprenticed with Junichi Arai, one of the pre-eminent textile designers of the last twenty years. She learned from Arai the importance of combining both the hand and advanced technology in textile design and production.

"Serge Chermayeff was born in the Caucasus in 1900 and recieved his education in England. Much of his early architectural work is there. He taught at the European Mediterranean Academy in Cavalière, France in the early 1930s. In 1939 he came to the US to accept a post at the San Francisco Art Institute and Brooklyn College while pursuing private practice. At Brooklyn College he was chairman of the design department from 1942-1946. He was later on the faculty of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Insititute of Technology.  In 1953 he accepted a position as head of the department of architecture at Harvard. From 1962-1970 he served as head of the architecture department at Yale. 
Among the noted buildings he designed are: the seaside Bexhill Pavillon in England; the Clarence Mayhew House in Oakland and the Horn House in Marin County, CA.
He was the author, with C. Alexander, of ""Community and Privacy: Toward a New Architecture of Humanism""(1963) and with Alexander Tzonis, of ""Shape of Community: Realization of Human Potential"" (1971).
He was the co-founder of the American Society of Planners and Architects. He also served as president, on recommendation of Gropius, of the Chicago Institute of Design.
He died at age 95 in Wellfleet, MA in 1996.",13,"American, b. Grozny, Chechnya  1900 – 1996",/m/09dgqj,18536373,611075,,,Serge Ivan Chermayeff,,0,0,8402,500011342,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18536373/,11415,46808185,3457421,23424977

"Originally founded in 1957 as Brownjohn, Chermayeff and Geismar, the ""Design Studio"" was strongly influenced by European Modern Art currents.  Characterized by a strong sense of form, their work exploits the vitality of repetition and texture. The firm distinguished itself in designs for album covers, graphic designs for books and plays and their inovative installation for the American Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  In 1960, Robert Brownjohn (1925-1970) left the firm.  Chermayeff & Geismar is known for their contribution to the corporate idenity movement with commissions from Chase Manhattan Bank and Mobil Corporation, for whom they designed logos, product design and advertising.",6,,,18053275,,,,Chermayeff & Geismar Associates,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053275/,,,,23424977

"Christ, as the artist prefers to be named, was born in Gabrovo,  Bulgaria in 1935. He studied at the Fine Arts Academy , Sofia, Bulgaria from 1952-56, the Burian Theater in Prague in 1956 and at the Fine Arts Academy in Viennia in 1957.  In 1960 he married Jeanne-Claude Guillebon with whom he collaborates on many of larger projects. 
In 1958 he began his first 'wrappings' often interpreted as a comentary on the packaging of experience in modern culture.  Ordinary objects are selected, sometimes randpomly, and wrapped in a variety of materials and secured with string, rope or tape.  In some cases, the wrapping changes the perception of the solidity, dimension and structure of the object.  
Christo is know for monumental projects undertaken in the late 1960s and continuing to the present. Among the best known are Wrapping the Reichstag Building in Berlin; The Valley Curtain Project, Colorado; and Running Fence, California.
Christo became a naturalized American citizen in 1973.",3,"American, b. Bulgaria 1935",,18053287,,,,Christo,,0,0,7378,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053287/,11069,17231583,,23424977

"Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871–1949) began his career as a painter, etcher and sculptor, but early on developed an interest in all manner of design and decorative arts, creating textiles, fashions, lamps, furniture and interiors, as well as designs for the stage. Believing that the artist should control every detail of production, Fortuny also invented and patented his own processes and machinery, in areas as varied as photography, lighting design, and textile printing. Born in Madrid and raised in Paris, he eventually made Venice his home and established his business there. The textile mill has been in almost continuous operation since it began with the introduction of the Delphos dress in 1907 (The factory was closed briefly after Fortuny died in 1949). 

While Fortuny’s textile designs draw heavily on the woven silks of Renaissance Italy, he also traveled extensively and drew inspiration from Persian silks, Coptic Egyptian ornament, and classical Greek garment styles.

"Lockwood de Forest (1850-1932) was the protégé of the celebrated nineteenth-century landscape painter Frederic E. Church.  Church trained de Forest in landscape painting during the early 1870s and while doing so engendered in his pupil a passion for exotic places and exotic decorative arts objects.  This interest led de Forest first to the Holy Land and Egypt and finally to India, where he set up an atelier in Ahmedabad to produce hand-carved Indian teak which he imported to the United States for use in interior decorating projects.  In Ahmedabad, he was introduced to Muggunbhai Hutheesing with whom he created a workshop for producing carved teak panels and metalwork by native Hindu mistri craftsmen.  Using these imported materials and other objects that he collected on his travels, de Forest provided decorative arts objects for interiors by Louis Comfort Tiffany with whom he had a brief partnership (1880-82). Working independently, de Forest designed interiors for his siblings Robert and Henry de Forest, Frederic  Church, Mary Garrett and M.  Cary Thomas (Bryn Mawr College); George Wroth Knapp (Baltimore); and William Henry Appleton (Wave Hill), among others.",1,"American, 1850 - 1932",,18065337,859,,,Lockwood de Forest,,0,0,16673,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065337/,,3616962,,23424977

"David Lance Goines was born in Oregon in 1945. He was drawn to the graphic arts by his interest in calligraphy prior to enrolling at the University of California, Berkley from which he was expelled at age nineteen for participating in the Free Speech Movement.  At the Berkley Free Press he worked as an apprentice pressman and also wrote, printed and bound a book on calligraphy there. After studing in London for a year, he returned to Berkely and opened a graphic design studio.
Goines purched the Berkley Free Press in 1971 and renamed it the Heironymous Press.  His poster style developed in tandem with his continued pursuit of printing books",1,b. 1945,,18043255,,,2208,David Lance Goines,,0,0,1290,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043255/,65850,96152390,34916595,23424977

"Born in Budapest in 1906, Eva Stricker entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at age 17, intending to become a painter, but her mother prevailed upon her to learn some trade whereby she could earn a living, the world of fine art being chancy. So Eva apprenticed herself to a traditional potter and began learning her trade. The life of the apprentice in any of the trades was not always easy or pleasant, but Eva persisted and soon graduated to journeyman status. Just a year after that her work was displayed at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial, where she won an honorable mention. By then she was working as a designer in the Kispester Factory in Budapest. She then advertised in the trade papers that she was a qualified journeyman seeking a position and received several responses. When asked recently why she chose the particular one she did she replied, ""Because it was the furthest from home."" She wanted to travel and widen her experience of the world and at the same time increase her skills. She moved to Berlin and on to other factories in Hamburg and throughout Europe. In 1932 she went to Russia on vacation in order to experience the new artistic and social movements there, as did many other idealistic young artists and intellectuals. As an experienced industrial designer she was soon offered a position assisting in the modernization of the ceramic industry, where her creativity and dynamism stood her well. She traveled to many parts of Russia in order to understand and coordinate the efforts to create a central manufactory which would make products for the homes of the everyday citizenry. Her efforts were recognized, and she was soon transferred to the Lomonosov factory in Leningrad (the former Imperial Porcelain Factory). This in turn led to her appointment as Artistic Director for the Porcelain and Glass Industries for the entire country.

In 1936, however, she was caught up in one of the Stalinist purges, accused of plotting against the life of Stalin. She was imprisoned in the NKVD prison for 16 months, most of the time in solitary confinement. She was subjected to early forms of brainwashing, torture, and the constant possibility that each day would be her last. (Arthur Koestler, a lifelong friend, based his book ""Darkness at Noon"" on her prison experiences.)

Then one day she was unexpectedly led out of her cell to what she feared was to be her execution and put on a train to Austria in the clothes she was standing in. Just as the reason for her imprisonment was never really known, so is the reason for her release.

Once in Austria, she left on the last train out at the time of the Anschluss and went to England, where she married Hans Zeisel, who had waited seven years for her. They then went to New York in 1938, where they settled permanently.

One of her first designs in the US was for Sears, Roebuck. She has since designed for Hall China, Red Wing China, Castleton China, Norleans Meito (Japan), Western Stoneware, Hyalyn, Phillip Rosenthal (Germany), Mancioli (Italy), Federal Glass, Heisey Glass, Noritake (Japan), and Nikkon Toki (Japan), and almost too many others to mention. 

Honors collected by Zeisel include being commissioned by Castleton China and The Museum of Modern Art to design a line of fine porcelain dinnerware, which was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in l947. She has received a senior award from the National Endowments for the Arts (l982), and was the subject of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs de Montreal, in l984. She taught ceramic arts industrial design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from l939 to l952. 


 
Her works are in the permanent collections of Brohan Museum, Berlin; The British Museum; The Brooklyn Museum; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and numerous others. She has had retrospective exhibitions in dozens of museums, has lectured widely, and has received two honorary doctorates in recognition of her work, among other honors.

Her recent works include designs for Zsolnay Factory in Pecs and Kispester-Granit in Budapest, as well as the American firms of KleinReid and Nambe. The Museum of Modern Arts and the Metropolitan Museum have both issued new releases of some of her early designs in new glazes and colors, always supervised by Zeisel. At age 96 she continues to produce new works regularly.",136,"American, born Hungary, 1906–2011",,18043295,,,,Eva S. Zeisel,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043295/,,,,23424977

"Carin Goldberg, the graphic designer and writer, was born on June 12, 1953 in New York. Currently based in New York, Goldberg has become an extremely influential designer. She is known for her quiet, uncluttered and ecclectic style of design which undoubtedly began to take shape during her time at The Cooper Union School of Art, in New York, where she recieved a Bachelor's of Fine Art. Soon after her graduation, from the mid-seventies to the early eighties she worked as a staff designer for CBS Television Network, CBS Records and Atlantic Records under art director Paula Scher.

         After her extensive experience in design and advertising for major music and televisioncorporations, in 1982 she established Carin Goldberg Design in New York where she is currently the principal. Her roster of clients include publishing houses such as Simon nd Schuster, Random House, Harper Collins, Hyperion, Doubleday, Time Inc., and Nonesuch Records, a music company.

        Carin Goldberg's work has been showcased in numerous exhibitions including and design annuals including the Walker Art Museum's ""Graphic Design in America"", the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's ""Mixing Messages"", and in Hong Kong's Heritage Museum in the ""Women Festival"" series. Her work has also been featured in magazines like Graphis, Time Magazine, Ad Week, Communication Arts, Print Casebooks, Metropolis, and Print. Goldberg's work can also be seen in Steven Heller's books ""Jackets and Covers"" and ""Typeplay"" and in her own recently published book, ""Catalog"", which she designed and authored.",12,6/12/53,,18043661,,,,Carin Goldberg,,0,0,1518,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043661/,,,,

"Paula Scher, the graphic designer and writer, was born in Washington D.C. in October 6th, 1948 and went to the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia where she majored in illustration and graduated with a Bachelors of Fine Art. Scher specializes in developing identity and branding systems, promotional materials, environmental graphics, packaging and publication designs that appeal to the general public. Her work can often be recognized by her use of the modernist typographic aesthetic, typified by the Swiss International Style. According to ID magazine; Scher credits her husband, the graphic designer, Seymour Chwast with teaching her how to use type. She has a unique talent for cming up with concepts and illustrating them with type; a skill she attributes to her teacher, the Polish designer, Stanislav Zagorski who she credits with influencing her to usetype in this way.

         Scher began her career in the 70's as a record cover art directorat both Atlantic and CBS Records with designers like Carin Goldberg. In 1984 she co-founded and became a partner in ""Koppel and Scher"" design company with Terry Koppel. After closing the studio in the early 90's, she became and still is a partner and principal at Pentagram, New York in 1991. 

        Although she has used her skills to create memorable works for clients including The New York Times, the American museum of Natural History, the Asia Society, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Phillips-VAn Heusen, Anne Klein, Citigroup, 
3Com, Herman Miller, Metropolis, and the New York Botanical Gardens; her most well-known and influential work has been created for the Public Theater. She describes how she ""defined the personality"" of the Public Theater in an interview with Ellen Lupton when she said, ""We made 'PUBLIC' big so that people would know they were going to the Public [Theater]. The theaters within the organization had to be subbranded. We made a round 'stamp' for each theater that goes with the word 'Public'."" In a Print magazine article by Steven Heller, Scher is credited with ""developing ...a design language unlike any other theater advertising ...She SHOUTS with type.""

       Scher's work has been included in the permanent collections of New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Zurich Poster Museum, the Denver Art Museum, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Scher's work has also been featured in the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's ""Mixing Messages"" exhibition and in Design, Print, and ID magazines. Her work can also be seen in ""American Typography Today"", ""The History of Graphic Design"", and in her own books ""The Graphic Design Portfolio"" and ""Make It Bigger"" both of which she designed and authored.",23,"American, b. 1948",/m/09zqzc,18043689,,,7070,Paula Scher,,0,0,1532,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043689/,,92536323,3764125,23424977

"Victor Moscoso (Spanish, b. 1936, active United States) studied at the Cooper Union in New York City and later at Yale University where he studied with Josef Albers. The influence of Albers is evident in Moscoso's use of contrasting color to creat enhanced visual effects. In 1959 he attended the San Francisco Art Institute.  In 1966, he designed posters for venues in San Francisco where rock bands of the burgeoning psychedelic movement played, notably Family Dog dances staged at The Avalon Ballroom. He created a series, titled Neon Rose, for Matrix, a San Francisco nightclub.",4,b. 1936,/m/052prf,18056695,,,4117,Victor Moscoso,,0,0,10946,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18056695/,25,81304006,1452234,23424950

"Armand G. Winfield has been involved professionally in the plastics field for over five decades. He graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in 1941 and did graduate work at the University of New Mexico, the State University of Iowa and at Washington University in St.Louis, Missouri. He began his career in museum work in the late 1930's and in the mid-1940's was a principal in Winfield Fine Art in Jewelry, a New York City Company involved in research and manufacturing of acrylic embedments. He has since been affiliated with such plastics concerns as Seymour Wallas & Co. and The Ritepoint Company - both in St. Louis, Missouri. He was Research Director of the Hanley Plastics Division of the Wallace Pencil Company in Brentwood, Missouri (1955-1957). In 1957, he was appointed Plastics Consulting Engineer at DeBell & Richardson, Inc. of Hazardville, Connecticut where he remained through 1963. Since January, 1964, he founded his own company where he has been an indipendent Plastics Consultant. Mr. Winfield has been on the teaching faculties of many Universities, Colleges and Istitutes and he also been a guest lecturer at over 30 other universities in the Unites States and abroad. In 1968 Armand G. Winfield was recipient of an United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). On June 9, 1970 The Plastics Institute in London elected Winfield as a Fellow. In 1972 Armand G. Winfield Inc. was retained by C.A.R.E., Inc. to design, develop and produce a low cost prototype house for Bangladesh, primarily using jute as the building material with polyester  binders.  In the 1974 the Winfields were retained by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to consult on their refurbishing of certain opera sets. In 1977, Armand G. Winfield was retained by UNIDO to field consult in India on New Fibres and Composites - and to demonstrate uses of these materials. In 1979, the Winfields completed the refurbishing of an amusement park on Long Island, New York. In early 1980, Armand Winfield was retained by the College of Santa Fe to produce and direct a Conference entitled ""Viable Energy and Living Alternatives for New Decade"".  In 1983, Winfield was invited to become a VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) Volunteer and later that year was elected to the Plastic Pioneers Association. During the past several years, the Winfields have been involved with machine design, product and process development, hydroponic farming and water storage systems for developing countries , recycling of plastics and non-plastics trash and industrial scrap, the development of Affordable housing systems for the United States, working in the electronic field and with new composites - and lecturing and writing for publication. Armand G. Winfield is the author of over 340 published articles, chapters and books on plastics and related subjects, almost 90 of which are concerned with plastics in building and architecture. Articles by the Winfields have been published in many countries around the world in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as in English. Armand G. Winfield is a member of many technical and scientific organizations around the world.",1,b. 1919,,18041403,,,,Armand G. Winfield,,0,0,281,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041403/,,,,

"Graphic designer and writer, Louise Fili, was born in Orange, New Jersey on April 15th, 1951. In 1973, she graduated from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York where an opportunity to work in the college typeshop inspired a deep love for typography. Fili specializes in logo, package, restaurant, type, book and book jacket design. She is known for her quiet pretty style of design, often incorperating older less popular typefaces from the 20's, 30's, and 40's. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described Fili's unique style and process when he wrote, ""Fili's work is elegant and refined, possessing great subtlety and even softness. Often, [the] typeface will be a style she remembers from old typographic specimens or will have to be radically altered to achieve her objectives. For Fili, the sad part of the death of handset metal typography is the loss of many wonderful old typefaces which are simply unavailable. She has worked around this problem by restoring letterforms from old printed specimens, commissioning hand lettering of the missinig letters or even the entire title and message."" 

           Louise fili began her design career in 1976 as a senior designer for Herb Lubalin Associates and left the Lubalin Studio in 1978 in order to accept a position as art director of Pantheon Books. Fili stayed at the Pantheon until 1989 when she left to found Louise fili Ltd. where she is currently principal.

           Although Fili has created over 2,000 book covers to date, much of her most well known work, including the book jacket for Marguerite Duras' ""The Lover"", were created during her time at Pantheon Books. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described her work at Pantheon when he wrote, ""Color and imagery also seem to resonate with the essence and spirit of the literature, almost as though Fili has focused more on the logo and food package design, especially on the creation of corporate identities for the restaurants including Picholine and Prix Fixe.

          Fili's work has been included in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. Her work has also been featured in Graphis, Step Inside Design, and Print magazines. Fili has also co-authored many design books with her husband Steven Heller including ""Italian Art Deco"", ""Dutch Moderne"", ""Streamline"", ""French Modern"", ""British Modern"", ""Deco Type"", ""German Modern"", ""Deco Espana"", ""Typology"", ""Belles Lettres"" and ""Cover Story"".",5,,,18041621,,,,Ms. Louise Fili,,0,0,399,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041621/,,,,

"One of Japan's leading graphic designers and art directors since the 1960s, Nagai trained at theTokyo National University of Fine Arts in scultpure but left in 1951 to work as a graphic designer for the Tokyo Spinning Co. in Osaka.  Starting in 1960, he worked for the Nippon Design Center, serving as its president and later as director.  By the early 1960s, he had developed a personal style of abstract, geometric, linear forms and patterns that create surreal landscapes. This style appeared in posters for Nikon; GQ magazine; and his freelance work of the 1970s and early 1980s.  By the late 1980s realistic elements entered his design vocabularly.  There have been several retrospective exhibitions of his work, the most recent at the Tokyo, National Museum of Modern Art in 1990.",3,"Japanese, b. 1929",,18053407,,,,Kazumasa Nagai,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053407/,,,,23424856

"Born in Fribourg, Switzerland, 22 May 1925, Jean Tinguely is associated with the renewed interest in the DaDa movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  From 1941-45, Tinguely studied at the School of Fine Arts in Basel, where he lived until 1952. There he was influenced by the collage constructions of Kurt Schwitters.  At this time he began his interest in movement in art.  After marring Eva Aeppli in 1951, they relocated to Paris where Tinguely worked with Daniel Spoerri in Jean Lurcat's studio on an ""autotheater"" project, which intended to bring action to the stage even in the absence of preformers.  Moving to Dusseldorf in 1959, he made many ""metareliefs""- motorized panels made of moving rods, as well as free standing sculptures.  In one of his early performances pieces, he dropped 150,000 copies of the manifesto Fur Statik from an airplane on Dusseldorf.  In late 1950's an early 1960s he developed the first of the ""painting machines"" which incorporated found, man-made and natural elements.  Concieved as a reaction to the then prevalent Abstract Expressionist style, he helped launch the Nouveau Realisme movement.  After moving  to New York in 1960, he constructd Homage à New York, an elaborate painting machine, in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art, which self destructed.",6,"Swiss, 1925 – 1991",,18046537,610546,,5882,Jean Tinguely,,0,0,3222,500010804,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046537/,75356,12338336,7328346,23424957

Two years later she began to work with Alexander Tairov at the Karmerny Theater, which became a laboratory for inventing new ways to design for the stage.

"Mr. William Day Gates founded the American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company in Terra Cotta, Ilinois, in 1881. The Gates Potteries developed as a branch of this company and was set up around 1890 to make plain, undecorated garden pottery.
The ""Teco"" name is derived from the first syllables of the words terra and cotta. The name was used as early as 1895 although the pottery was not available to the public until 1901.
The parent company, American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company (founded in 1881) was sold, five years before William Gates's death in 1935.",2,1881-1935,,18055535,,,,American Terracotta and Ceramic Company,,0,0,10331,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055535/,,,,

They do faux painting, gilding, decorative objects, wallpapers and textiles.  This past summer Alpha artisans were responsible for painting the faux marble and faux bois on the walls, floors and stairways of Gracie Mansion.  Their fabrics and wallpapers are sold through the Pollack showroom in the D&D Building.  Many of the Alpha Workshop trainees are hired to work in their studio.  Alpha staff carve the blocks and print the papers in their studio.  Many of the designs are printed on hand-painted backgrounds.   

The Alpha Workshops wallpapers have been featured in Elle Décor, House Beautiful and Country Living magazines. Their wallpapers were recently nominated for an International Design Award by Elle Décor magazine.

"Augustus Charles Pugin possibly came to England during the French Revolution, although the exact circumstances and date of his arrival are not known. In 1792, he 
entered the Royal Academy Schools and worked as a draftsman for John Nash
(1752–1835). In 1799, he exhibited a design for a villa at the Royal Academy. His architectural drawings were outstanding for their clarity and accuracy, and he worked frequently as an illustrator of architectural treatises. Some of his most notable contributions are illustrations for The Microcosm of London (1808) and two volumes of Specimens of Gothic Architecture (1818). After the success of Specimens, Pugin worked for Nash between 1819 and 1824, drawing the plates for The Royal Pavilion at Brighton (1826).

He was not very active as a practicing architect, but probably provided designs for other architects. In 1826–27, he exhibited three designs for cemeteries, and in 1830 he was associated with the layout of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London.

"Louis Sullivan (American, 1956-1924) was one of the most significant  American architects of any era. His work provides a transition from the nineteenth century academic world to the twentieth century. Like his teacher and mentor, Henry Hobson Richardson he considered the decorative elements of his buildings with a particularly keen sense of the aesthetic movement tempered with a strong architectural rationalism.  The Chicago Stock exchange of 1893 was one of Adler (Dankmar) and Sullivan's major commissions, showing a modern aesthetic when compared with the more Beaux Arts styles of some of the buildings at the contemporary World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.",3,"American, 1856 – 1924",,18050521,,,5723,Louis Henry Sullivan,,0,0,5877,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050521/,6697,14805742,52717,23424977

"M. Leon Decloux (b. November 11, 1840 d. May 26, 1929) belonged to a Parisian family whose members were mainly contractors of works of various sorts.  After having begun in the firm directed by his father, at the side of his eldest brother Edouard, he established a gilding shop, then a housepainting enterprise which he rapidly expanded.
He demonstrated at an early age a very marked taste for the art of the 18th century, then fairly unkown, and he was interested in all forms of the art of that era - furniture, engravings, knick-knacks, porcelain as well as the decorative style created by the 18th century artists.  While yet a young man, he began diligently frequenting the auction house and started acquiring, in proportion to his still modest means, some art ojects of quality which his natural good taste enabled him to discover in the public sales and in the antique shops.
His deep study of the style of Louis XVI led him to specialize his painting business in the execution of ornamental painting of that period and he restored, notably, the color ""Louis XVI grey"" which had entirely fallen out of fashion in the Parisian salons, replaced by the deep toned colors adopted at the end of the 19th century.  Some connoisseurs then entrusted to him the complete decoration and furnishings of several private houses of Paris.  He proved, at that time, his taste and knowledge and realized some remarkable decorative ensembles, such as the Hotels de Bretueuil, de Fels, etc.
Devoting himself more and more to the study of the art objects of the epoque of his preference, while still young, he turned over his commercial enterprise to a relative who had become his associate, to such an extent that he would be able to use all his time to collect on his own.  Among his activities in this realm he established a very complete collection of engravings of the modes of the 18th century.  It is this collection which he later sold to some connoisseurs of the United States who gave them to the New York Museum of Decorative Arts.  Up until his last years, M. Decloux did not stop folowing the large sales of art objects and frequenting the Parisian antique dealsers and he continued to group around him a most important collection of furniture and various brick-brack, always of excellent workmanship and notably among these, a very beautiful colleciton sof Severe soft paste porcelain and of porcelains and faiences of the principal French and foreign manufacturers of the 18th century.
Thus, in the course of a long life, M. Decloux, who remained unmarried, lived only for the art of the period which he loved, surrounded by precious objects which he had patiently assembled, guided only by the instinct and personal taste of a born collector.

"Fuchs studied textile design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel and Zurich and worked in the textile field before becoming interested in jewelry.  Her jewelry has been exhibitied in many one-man shows at galleries and museums thaorughout Europe in the 1980s, including Gallery RA in Amsterdam, the Electrum gallery in London, and the Musee d'art et d'histoire in Geneva.  Her works are in the permanent collecitons of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and many others magor European museums.
Beadwork is a special interst of Sieber-Fuchs, bridging textile and jewelry design as has her career.  In addtion to traditional glass beads, she has also incorporated such unconventional meterials as tiny bits of unexposed photographic film and chopped up newpaper financila pages into her jewelry designs.  Working in Zurich, a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing, perhaps it is not suprising the Sieber-Fuch should turn to pill packaging for its possibilities in texture and ornament.",1,"Swiss, b. 1943",,18051009,,,,Verena Sieber-Fuchs,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051009/,,,,23424957

"Edward Ruscha was born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska and moved to Oklahoma City when he was five. After studing art in high school, Ruscha moved to Los Angeles and took classes in graphic design at Chouniard Institute and the Walt Disney school for animators (later CAL Arts). Among his influences are the Dada Movement and the paintings of Jasper Johns and  Robert Rauschenberg. His books ""Twenty Six Gas Stations""(1963) and ""Every Building on the Sunset Strip"" (1966) underscored his interest in the every day aspects of contemporary American life.  In the mid 1960s, under the pseudonym Eddie Russia, he was the designer for the contempory art magazine ARTFORUM.  His prints and paintings of words and simple short phrases link Ruscha to both Pop Art and Post-Modernism.  His hard edged, tightly rendered images, show a   fascination with American trompe l'oeil paintings of the nineteenth century and  photography.",2,"American, b. 1937",,18053897,1022,,5086,Edward Ruscha,,0,0,7705,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053897/,37425,54182318,1311849,23424977

"German pottery established at Karlsruhe 1901. Was the resulting combination of two endeavors: ceramic studio set up by painter Wilhelm Süs in 1898 at Kronberg, which produced majolica in the style of Italian Renaissance, and the Oberursel workshop of painter Hans Thoma. Production at Karlsruhe began in 1901. Artists included Hans Meid, Konrad Taucher, Georg Schreyögg, Emil Rudoff Weiss. In 1909 facotry moved to larger facility in Hartwald, where it included ornamental ware for parks, gardens, and cemeteries in its production.  In 1913 court administration of Karlsruhe ceased, and administration of the factory changed hands during the following years. In 1920s its designers included Laueger, Ludwig König, Paul Speck. Factory came under state ownership in 1927, and from thenceforth was known as Majolika-Manufaktur Karlsruhe AG.

"Tommi Parzinger was born in Munich and received professional design training there at the school of art and craft, Kunstgewerbeschule. He began his career as a freelance designer of ceramics, wallpapers, lighting, textiles, furniture. He traveled and worked in Germany and Austria, becoming familiar with the modern movements of the day including the Jugendstijl, the Bauhaus, and the Wiener Werkstatte.As a professional designer in Germany he created porcelain for the German firm KPM, as well as posters, textiles, interiors and wallpapers. In 1932 he came to the United Stated as a prize for winning a poster contest for North German Lloyd. In 1935, he settled in New York and became associated with Rena Rosenthal (""smart furniture and accessories shop"") as a designer of china, glassware and furniture. Furniture became his primary focus and in 1938 he became a designer for Charak of Boston. In 1939, he formed his own business, Parzinger, Inc., renamed Parzinger Originals in 1946. Donald Cameron became his partner. In addition, he designed furniture, fabrics, lighting and range of accessories for other firms, including Salterini (wrought iron); Hofstatter (furniture); Dorlyn (brass); Willow & Reed (rattan). He produced custom designs for interior decorators and his many private clients. Parzinger furnishings changed very little over the years. Rooted in Viennese style, the main characteristics of the furniture were simplicity and a sense of proportion, rich wood textures ornamented with handmade hardware. His designs for silver, ceramics, lighting and glassware used light and joyful animal or floral motifs. In 1996 and 1998 his work was shown by Palumbo Gallery, 972 Lexington Avenue, New York City.",156,"American, born Germany, 1903 - 1981",,18049811,,,,Tommi Parzinger,,0,0,5482,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049811/,,,35622315,23424977

"While he was perhaps better known as an architect and furniture designer, between 1909 and 1950 Josef Frank also designed more than 200 textiles. He was familiar with the business from an early age: his father, Ignaz Frank, was a partner in a large textile production firm, and his mother was a highly skilled embroiderer whose work was shown at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. Frank produced his first textile design while still studying architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. 

His interest in pattern design was not unique among Viennese architects like Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, Otto Czeschka, and Dagobert Peche, and he produced several early designs for the Wiener Werkstatte. However, unlike other Wiener Werkstatte designers, who created a unified design scheme by using the same pattern throughout an interior, on textiles, wallcoverings, and even fashion, Frank preferred an eclectic combination of fabrics in his interiors. 

Frank opened a retail shop with Oskar Wlach, who ran the business, called Haus & Garten, which offered furniture, textiles, rugs, and interior design services, and where he acted as the principle designer. But, in 1933 amid rising anti-Semitism in Austria, Frank accepted an offer from Estrid Ericson to work as chief designer for the interior design firm Svenkst Tenn, and moved with his family to Sweden. By the late 1930s, his work with the firm was closely associated with Swedish Modern design, in particular his light, unpretentious cotton prints that were strongly influenced by Indian chintz fabrics, botanical drawings and field guides.",1,"Swedish, b.

"Paul Rand was born in New York City and studied at Pratt Institute, the Art Student's League and Parsons School of Design. While at the League he studied with George Grosz. Author of ""Thoughts on Design,"" an influential book of design practices published in 1946, Rand incorporates collage and montage techniques to create a dynamic visual / verbal communications vocabulary.  Paul Klee and Wasilly Kandinsky provided a starting point for Rand who adapted formal qualities from their Modernist paintings to his graphic designs.  
Rand was the art director of Esquire  and Apparel Arts magazines from 1937 to 1941 and director of the William H. Weintraub advertising agency where he worked in collaboration with Bill Bernbach on the Orbach's department store campaign. His work with Bernbach is marked by a close association between graphics and copy.  He also contributed covers to the cultural journal Direction from 1938 to 1945.
Rand was design consultant for International Business Machines, Westinghouse and Cummins Engine Co. In 1956 he created the logo for IBM. He also designed the logos for Westinghouse, United Parcel Service and the American Broadcasting Company.
Rand received a gold medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, awards from the New York Art Directors Hall of Fame and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Philadelphia College of Art. He taught at Pratt, the Cooper Union and Yale University.
Other books by Rand include: Paul Rand: A Designer's Art; The Trademarks of Paul Rand (Wittenborn, 1960); Design and the Play Instinct (G.Braziller, 1965); Advertisement: Ad Vivum or Ad Hominem?

"Michael Thonet opened his first cabinetry workshop in a rural Austrian town in 1819, where he experimented with the process of using steam to bend wood for furniture.  Shortly after he founded his company ""Gebruder Thonet,"" or Thonet Brothers (1853).  In 1856, he obtained the first patent for the bentwood process.  Although his patent expired in 1869, by 1900, Thonet owned fifty-two assembly line production factories for bentwood furniture across Europe.  Numerous replicas of his most famous chair, the Viennese cafe chair known as model no. 14, abound today.  A New York office opened in the United States in 1873 and was later sold into subsidiaries, whereas in Europe the Thonet family remained involved in the Art Noveau movement.",5,,,18054021,633355,,5866,Thonet Brothers,,0,0,7769,500034100,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18054021/,42656,143911684,,

"Sculptor and Ceramic artist, born in Judenburg.  He learned the pottery trade from his father.  In 1891 he went to the painting school for the pottery industry in Znaim, then 1894 to the Vienna Industrial Arts School.  In 1906 he founded with Bertold Loffler the workshop ""Wiener Keramik"", which also worked for the ""Wiener Werkstatte"".  In 1912 Wiener Keramik was taken over by the ""Gmundner Keramik"" under the leadership of Powolny's pupil Franz Schleiss.  In 1909 Powolny was appointed instructor of the ceramic industry class of the Vienna Industrial Arts School and in 1932 he became a sculptor at the school.

"Born at Great Marlow, Joseph Nash began his drafting career studying Gothic architecture under Augustus Charles Pugin. He went with Pugin to Paris in 1829 to make drawings for Paris and Its Environs (1830), and lithographed the plates in Pugin’s Views Illustrative of Examples of Gothic Architecture (1830). From 1831 to 1879, he exhibited at the Royal Academy; and exhibited at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle, receiving an honorable mention. His early exhibits at the Society of
Painters in Water Colours were mainly illustrations for Shakespeare and contemporary poetry and novels; Tudor and Elizabethan architecture of Knole, Hampton Court, and Speke Hall were also frequent subjects. His published works
include Architecture of the Middle Ages (1838); The Mansions of England in the
Olden Time, published in four sets of twenty-six lithographs (1839–49); Scotland
Delineated (1847–54); and Views of Windsor Castle (1848). (JGK)",4,"British, 1808 - 1878",,18050891,,,,Joseph Nash The Elder,,0,0,6071,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050891/,3546,122246433,,23424975

"Giovanni Giacomo De' Rossi was the son of the founder of the most important and active printing press of the 17th century in Rome. Begun in 1633 by his father Giuseppe (1570-1639), the press passed firstly to Giacomo and to his brother Giandomenico (1619-1653), and then later to Lorenzo Filippo (1682-?); in 1738 it became the Calcografia Camerale, from 1870 until 1945 the Regia Calcografica, and today it is known as the Calcografia Nazionale. Here are conserved, amongst many others, the plates of Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778). Giacomo De' Rossi was the most involved of all the various family members who ran the press, and he worked between 1638 and 1691, and was to take the company to the height of its success. The artists that he printed the etchings for included Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1665), Pietro Testa (1612-1650) and Giovan Francesco Grimaldi (1606-1680).

"Josef Müller-Brockman (1914-1995) was a pioneering force in the Swiss school of graphic design and one of the most internationally respected members of his design generation.  The Swiss style grew out of European and Russian modernist graphics including constructivist, French modernist, Futurist, Dada, De Stijl and Bauhaus.  Because Switzerland remained neutral during World War II, it was able to to continue the exploration of modern graphic design.  After the war, Muller-Brockmann and his colleagues expanded on early modernist design ideas to formulate a strict set of conventions for the use of photomontage and typography within a mathematically based grid layout.  Because Müller-Brockmann taught at the Zurich School of Arts and Crafts (from 1957) and published many books detailing the elements of the Swiss graphic style, what began as a local movement soon grew into an international style whose influence can still be found in contemporary graphic design, particularly in areas of public signage, institutional graphics and corporate identity programs (Vignelli, Chermayeff and Geismar, April Greiman, among others).",4,"Swiss, 1914 – 1995",/m/04xsmy,18051541,,,4154,Josef Müller-Brockmann,,0,0,6432,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051541/,54279,34450286,1375695,23424957

"Brian Connelly (1926-63) is a self-taught American artist.  Little is known about Connelly, but in the late 1940s or early 1950s he became involved with Associated American Artists (AAA), a profitable gallery and organization that was founded in 1934 by Reeves Lewenthal.  Lewenthal and AAA played a central role in “linking modern American art and consumerism” by producing limited edition fine art prints by American artists such as Connelly as well as more famous names as Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood.",1,"American, 1926 - 1962",,18055323,,,,Brian Connelly,,0,0,10216,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055323/,,,27413027,23424977

"Retail establishment and product design. Design Research, Inc. (D/R), founded in 1953 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by architect Benjamin Thompson, specialized in the latest post- war products for the modern home. The displays in the stores were considered unique in that they were designed at domestic scale and the products were shown in realistic, homelike arrangements. Products were sought and selected based on the anticipated preferences of customers, not on traditional retail buying patterns. As the time, the availability of ""good design"" was limited to wholesale firms such as Herman Miller and Knoll. Thompson was the first to introduce the work of many European and Asian designers to the American retail market, including the work of the design firm of Marimekko for wich D/R was the exclusive U.S. representative. The company also created many of its own products including chairs manufactured by Thonet. D/R later opened stores in New York City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Thompson's own architectural firm, Benjamin Thompson & Associates, Inc., designed all of the D/R stores. For the San Francisco store, Thompson renovated the former Ghirardelli Chocolate factory. Even after the stores officially closed in 1978, D/R remained a model for many merchants.",3,"American, 1953 – 1979",,18051185,,,,"Design Research, Inc.",,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051185/,,,,23424977

"The Romanian-born Steinberg studied architecture in Milan beginning in 1933, but soon after began publishing cartoons, and by the time he graduated in 1940, his drawings were appearing in Life and Harper’s Bazaar. In 1941, anti-Jewish laws in Fascist Italy forced him to immigrate to the United States. He began publishing regularly in The New Yorker, a relationship that lasted almost sixty years and produced ninety covers and over a thousand drawings and cartoons. Steinberg was an Artist in Residence at the Smithsonian in 1967, and is well represented in the Smithsonian collections, with at least forty works in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.",14,"American, b.

"Hiroshige (1797-1858) Japanese painter and printmaker, known for his landscape prints. Last great figure of the Ukiyo-e school of printmaking. Inspired by the prints of Hokusai, he studied and was apprennticed to, Utagawa Toyohiro. From 1811 to 1830 he created prints of traditional subjects, young women and actors. 1830 to 1845 he concentrated on landscape prints, reaching fame in 1833 with the print series Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. Other travel series, Celebrated Places in Japan, and Sixty-nine Stations on the Kiso Highway, also display the high level of craftsmanship for which he is known. In the later period of his life, the increasing popularity of his images resulted in a falling off of the technical brillance of the earlier work.

"Lanette Scheeline was born in 1910 in Northen California. She graduated from the College of Fine Arts at the University of California at Berkeley in 1932. She also took a textile design course at UCLA and a year of course work at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. After teaching Art for one year, Lanette Scheeline began to work for Louma Prints, a textile silkscreen factory in San Francisco. Her work with Louma was cut short by WWII, when she moved to Marin county, to work in a shipyard. After two years of war she established her own design studio in Mill Valley, CA.
It is after 1945 that she designed the wallpaper. She met William Katzenbach, the primary partner for the New York based wallpaper firm Katzenbach and Warren, described in Interiors Magazine of April 1955 as ""Consistently avant guard in both design and technical innovations"". Around 1955 Lanette Scheeline produced a new type of mural decoration for Katzenbach, the ""Tree"" series. She moved to New York around 1960.",97,"American, 1910 - 2001",,18045691,,,,Lanette Scheeline,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045691/,,,,23424977

"After graduating from Cranbrook and moving ot New York in the 1960s Mary Walker Phillips began concentrating on knitting with the support of Jack Lenor Larsen.  She became an expert on the subject and the best creative knitter.  Mary's books include ""Step by Step Knitting"" 1967, ""Step by Step Macrame"" 1970, ""Creative Knitting, A new Art Form"" 1971, 1986; ""Knitting Counterpanes, Traditional Coverlet Patterns for Contemporary Knitters"" 1989.  In the Step by Step series (which included wabing, ceramics, etc.) she introduces basics in a very clear format.  In ""Creative Knitting"" she presents knitting as an art form for the first time and in a period when so-called fibber arts movement was still growing and probably at its height.",5,"American, 1923 - 2007",/m/0f810c,18045647,,,,Mary Walker Phillips,,0,0,2717,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045647/,,113941266,5833004,23424977

"Henry Dreyfuss, American industrial designer, was born in New York City, New York in 1904 and died in Pasadena, California in 1972. 
At the New York Society for Ethical Culture's High School he learned the rudiments of staging theatrical production and in 1923, he became active as a stage designer for the theatre productions on Broadway. He worked as an apprentice with Norman Bel Geddes on several hit shows, and also as design consultant for Macy's, where he insisted on collaborating with the manufactures. In 1927 Dreyfuss set out on his own and in 1928 opened his own office in New York; subsequently, opened a second office in Pasadena, California. Soon, he distinguished himself as a designer for mass production. By favoring practically over art deco and streamlined styling, he gained the use of anthropometrics (the study of human dimensions and capabilities) into his practice; the results of this study were published in a series of volumes by MIT Press and discussed in his books Designing for People (1955) and The Measure of Man (1960). Dreyfuss became a founding member of the Society of Industrial Design and first president of the Industrial Designers Society of America. The vast number of objects Dreyfuss designed included aircraft interiors for Lockheed, hearing aids, clocks, Bell telephones (1930-33 Bell300 and 1965 Trimline model), Hoover products (from 1934), RCA TV sets (from1964), decanters for Thermos, farm vehicles for John Deere (including 1956 720 tractor), oceanliners Constitution and 1951 Independence, and New York Central Railroad's 1941 Twentieth Century Limited, which was more extravagant than usual for Dreyfuss. 
In 1968, after retiring from his design firm, Dreyfuss remained consultant to Bell Laboratories, Polaroid, and others.",58,"American, 1904–1972",/m/05p6rp,18041501,656174,,,Henry Dreyfuss,,0,0,335,500059346,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041501/,,8198939,1697559,23424977

"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born on November 24, 1864 in southern France.
Son and heir of Comte Alphonse-Charles de Toulouse, he was the last in the line of an aristocratic family that dated back a thousand years. Today, the family estate
houses the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec. At age twelve Toulouse-Lautrec broke his left leg and at fourteen his right leg. The bones did not heal properly, and his legs ceased to grow. He reached maturity with a body trunk of normal size but with abnormally short legs. He was only 4 1/2 feet (1.5 meters) tall.
Deprived of the physical life that a normal body would have permitted, Toulouse-Lautrec lived completely for his art. He dwelt in the Montmartre section of Paris, the center of the
cabaret entertainment and bohemian life that he loved to depict in his work. Dance halls and nightclubs, racetracks, prostitutes- all these were memorialized on canvas or made into
lithographs. 
In order to join in the Montmartre life - as well as to fortify himself against the crowd's ridicule of his appearance -Toulouse-Lautrec began to drink heavily. By the 1890s the
drinking was affecting his health. He was confined first to a sanatorium and then to his mother's care at home, but he could not stay away from alcohol. Toulouse-Lautrec died on
September 9, 1901, at the family chateau of Malrome.",1,1864 – 1901,,18053903,,,,Henri Marie Raymo Toulouse-Lautrec,,0,0,7708,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053903/,,,,

"In 1957 weaver and artist Anni Albers began her lengthy association with Knoll Textiles acting as a consultant on a line of new textiles, which included a series of casement fabrics. These fabrics are typical of Albers work during her years as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus, as well as her later work in the United States where she and her husband, Josef Albers, emigrated in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College (1933-49). The design of these casement fabrics recalls her entirely functional approach to textiles with an ongoing curiosity about and experimentation with new fibers and techniques.",41,"American, b.

"Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Testa trained (1940-1945) at the Institute of Design in Chicago, the former ""New Bauhaus,"" under Lazlo Moholy Nagy and the textile artist Marli Ehrman.  While still a student, he devised a rational theory for printed textiles and wallpapers that challenged the Bauhaus's strictly functionalist emphasis on textured woven (as opposed to printed) fabrics.   He reasoned, ""The textile designer…must determine what the function of [the] fabric is and what justification he has for putting a design on it.  He needs to experiment with line, form, texture, and colour, …and refrain from complete coverage, destroying the natural beauty of the textile.  Texture should be emphasized where the decorative function of the fabric is minimized, and colour and form where the function is purely decorative.""  Two years after graduating from the Institute of Design, Testa set up his own firm Angelo Testa & Co. Yet he never actively promoted his design business, unlike his better-known contemporaries Ben Rose and Ruth Adler Schnee, which may explain why his name is not more familiar to the general public.

As a painter as well as a designer, Angelo Testa was familiar with the work of contemporary abstract artists.  Between 1942 and 1960, he introduced to textile design abstract and nonobjective patterns using combinations of thick and thin lines, solid and outlined forms, positive and negative spaces, and ""clean pure colors.""  Some designs were screenprinted by his own firm, others were produced by Greef, Forster Textiles Mills, Knoll Associates, and Cohn-Hall-Marx, all for the up-scale market.  These and his mass-produced roller printed designs (1947), which appeared as illustrations in shelter magazines, contributed to the rise of abstract printed textiles in Europe, especially in England.",7,"(American, 1921–1984)",,18046223,,,,Angelo Testa,,0,0,3036,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046223/,,,,

"Chwast studyed drawing with Sidney Delevante at  Cooper Union, graduating with Milton Glaser, Ed Sorel and Reynold Ruffins in 1951.  His drawing style was influenced by Paul Klee, Roualt and Ben Shahn.  After working at the New York Times, Esquire, House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Chwast, with Sorel and Ruffins developed Push Pin Studio in 1954. Producing a wide variety of illustrations, posters, typography and animation, as well as design for packaging, magazines, record albums and book covers, Chwast's designs are a sophisticated blend of raucous colors, and comic book drawing.  Often incorporating inventive typographic juxtapositions appropriated from over a century of handbills, illustrations and advertising, Chwast has influenced a generation of graphic designers and and typographers.  In 1971 He was elected to the Board of Directors, American Institute of Graphic Arts and in 1971-72 he co-designed and directed ""Audience"" magazine.  He was appointed a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale in 1975, the same year he founded Push Pin Press.  He edited and published Push Pin Graphic in 1976, became Director of Pushpin Luballin Peckolick in 1982 and was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1984.  Since 1985 he has been Director of The Pushpin Group.
He has had many one person exhibitions in New York, California and Florida as well as London, Paris, Vienna, Warsaw and many other European capitals.  In March 1970 Push Pin Studios was the subject of a two month retrospective at the Museé des arts decoratif.  Chwast has been a member of the faculty of the Cooper Union and The School of Visual Arts and also lectures to student and professional groups.",10,"American, b. 1931",,18042087,,,1122,Seymour Chwast,,0,0,656,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042087/,13526,96524183,1750945,23424977

"Architect, Keith Murray (English, born in New Zealand, 1892-1981) was a notable and influential Modernist designer in the fields of glass, ceramics and metalware from 1920 through the start of World War II. He was one of the first designers to be honored for his contributions to industry, awarded the title of Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts, in 1936.

Murray trained and worked as an architect until the early 1930s, when he was forced to seek work outside his field due to the Great Depression. Inspired by the 1925 Exposition in Paris and the 1931 Exhibition of Swedish Industrial Art in London, with its emphasis on co-operation between manufacturers and artists, he produced some glass designs.  He was subsequently hired by the glass firm of Stevens and Williams as a freelance designer, from 1932-1939. His designs ranged from vases to decanters to bathroom sets. Although Murray preferred pure form with minimal to no decoration, he recognized the need to design for a range of consumer tastes and created a wide variety of both traditional and  modern forms. 

In 1932 the ceramics manufacturer Wedgwood engaged Murray part-time to design a range of modern shapes. The simple forms designed by Murray were either plain or had broad geometric fluting or bands. The purity of form was underscored by the use of matte glazes in white, green, turquoise, straw and gray. Murray designed a variety of objects, including vases, book ends, inkwells, beer jugs, and mugs.

Murray also created metalwork for the firm Mappin and Webb. His designs in silver and silver plate were modern and mostly geometric in form. Decoration was limited to turned rings which both enhanced the shapes and made the pieces easy to clean.

In 1936 Murray was commissioned to design Wedgwood's new factory at Barlaston. Following the war he left the field of industrial design and returned to architecture full time.  His design work is in the permanent collections of  the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Wedgwood Museum, and the Corning Glass Museum, among others, and has been included in exhibitions on ceramics and 20th-century design.

"Luca Giordano was born in Naples on October 18, 1632.  As apprentice to his father Antonio Giordano, a painter, Giordano first achieved great distinction for his ability to replicate old masters and quickly earned the nickname 'Proteo della pittura.'  His early works were greatly influenced by the Spanish painter Giuseppe Ribera, but there is no concrete proof that Giordano was, in fact, his pupil.  In 1654, Giordano traveled to Rome for the first time and then continued further to Bologna, Parma, and Venice.  In Venice he became greatly inspired by Titian and Veronese.  From these artists Giordano derived his own distinctly airy and decorative composition as well as an appreciation for vibrant colors.  Giordano is distinguished by his large oevre which expands diverse subject including mythological, religious, historical, battle scenes, still lifes, genre, and portraits.  In 1692, Charles II invited Giordano to Spain.  There he was assigned official Court Painter.  For the next ten years, Giordano executed many great works for the King as well as for the nobility including frescoes for S. Lorenzo, El Escorial; Palacio Real and Buen Retino, Madrid; a Cathedral in Toledo; and a Convent in Quadalupe. In 1702 Giordano returned to Naples.  In 1705 he passed away and was buried at the church of S. Brigida, which he had decorated fifty years prior.  The last three years of his life, Giordano executed some of his most important works including the S. Francesco di Sales; S. Carlo Borromeo for Gerolomini church; and perhaps the most influential: the dome of Certosa di San Martino.  This last work opened the doors to 18th century Rococo decorative style.  His stylisitic legacy was passed down through many followers and pupils as 'Giordanismo.'

"Keith Haring was born in Reading, PA, 4 May 1958 and raised in the nearby town of Kutztown.  Prior to moving to New York City in 1978, Haring studied art at the Ivy School and The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.  From 1978 to 1980 Haring attended the School of Visual Arts in New York.   Inspired by the graphic strength of graffiti, Haring's ""comic book"" style of drawing developed early in the 1980s when he created iconographic characters which he drew on the subway walls.  Concerned with topics as diverse as AIDS, nuclear holocaust and ecology, Haring employed images of crawling babies, rainbows and barking dogs that serve as emblems of the human condition.  A performance artist, poet and videoartist, Haring made a considerable impact on the East Village art scene in the early 1980s.  He exhibited drawings and paintings in the United States and Europe throughout the 1980s and accepted mural commissions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and New York. He died of AIDS 16 February 1990.",7,"American, 1958 – 1990",,18053541,,,,Keith Allen Haring,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053541/,,,,23424977

"Alfons Bach was born in Germany in 1904. He studied film directing and design in Europe before coming to the United States in 1926.
Bach settled in the New York metropolitan area. His projects included the remodeling of Sach's furniture store, which occupied the first several floors of the Manhattan's Hoover Building. Bach was responsible for remodeling both the exterior of the building and the interiors of the store. Another major commission was the redesign of the Seneca Textile Building on 34th Street; Bach won an award from the Fifth Avenue Association for his work on this project.
Bach designed and built his own home in Stamford, CT in 1938. Beginning in the late 1940s, he spearheaded a plan for what became on of the first shopping malls in America; the Ridgeway Center of Stamford. Bach designed the entire shopping mall, including many of the individual stores' interiors. The editors of Exhibitor and Theatre Catalog selected Bach's Ridgeway Theatre for their merit award.
After moving to Florida in 1959, Bach continued his design practice. A major project was the Palm Trial Plaza, a marina apartment complex in Delray Beach. Bach was selected to direct the United States exhibits at the 1962 International Industrial Design Exhibition in Paris.
Bach was a noted watercolor painter as well a designer. His paintings were featured in numerous exhibitions in the United States and America.",444,"German, 1904 – 1999",,18053553,,,,Alfons Bach,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053553/,,,,23424829

"Metalworker, furniture and industrial designer. Born New York City, September 26, 1909. Wallance             graduated New York University in 1930 with a B.A. in English Literature. He traveled to northern Europe            where he was exposed to the International Style in architecture and design. Upon returning to the United            States, he went to work in his father's furniture store and saw the need for more inventive designs in retail furnishings. He attended Design Laboratory School in New York City from its inception in 1936 until it closed its doors in 1940. From 1941-2, Wallance served as the state of Louisiana's technical and design director for the National Youth Administration, established in 1940 by President Roosevelt to help build a young, technically capable work force. During World War II, Wallance designed mass-produced furniture for servicemen's families living abroad for the Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington. He began designing tableware, cutlery, and accessories for H.E. Lauffer in 1951. 
 Among his most recognizable designs for Lauffer were Design One, a highly sculptural, brushed stainless steel flatware created in 1953, and Design Ten, a colored plastic flatware created in 1978-79. Both designs are now produced by Towle Manufacturing Company. In addition, Wallance designed auditorium seating in steel and upholstered polyurethane foam for Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in 1964 and hospital furniture in steel and plastics for Hard Manufacturing Company in 1965. Wallance is best known for his book, ""Shaping America's Products"", 1956, which remains a seminal study of the relationship of craftsmanship to industry.",1049,"American, 1909 – 1990",,18053597,,,,Donald A.

A native of Springfield, Massachusetts he studied at the Art Students League in New York City and later at the Woodstock, New York art colony. Cook moved to Taos, New Mexico in the 1930s where he engaged in the art colony there. During his career he received two Guggenheim Fellowships and was elected an Academician in the National Academy of Design. He earned a national reputation as a painter, muralist, and printmaker. 

His career included one-person exhibitions at the Denver Art Museum (1927) and the Museum of New Mexico (1928). Later in his career, Cook became an artist war correspondent in the Pacific theater during World War II.  (exerpted from exhibition text in ""Howard Cook: Prints from the C.

"The son of a tailor, Bosse was born in 1602 in Tours, France.  He was active as an engraver in Paris by the age of 20, living on the Ile du Palais.  His earliest works were based on designs of other artists including Jacques Bellange and Jean de Saint-Igny.  The collaborated with Jacques Callot during Callot's stay in Paris in 1629-1631.  By 1625, Bosse was in touch with Melchior Tavernier, the Flemish engraver and printer who until his death in 1641, published many of Bosse's works.  He was a friend of some of the intellectuals of his time.  Pierre Desargues, the mathematician and friend of Descartes, was Bosse's friend.  
     Bosse taught perspective at the Royal Academy of Painting and Scuupture beginning in 1648.  His lectures were published in 1665 as Traité des practiques géomètrales et perspectives... He was made an Honorary academician in 1651, but then after arguments with Charles Le Brun and others, he was excluded from membership.  His views on theory and practive were published in 1667 in Le Peintre converty aux précises et universelles règles de son art.  
     His career falls into two phases.  The first starts in 1622 and runs to 1641, when his publisher Tavernier dies.  From the 1640s on he was active mainly as a writier, illustrator, and sometimes as a publisher, and he made few independent plates.  He appears to become less active as a print maker in his later years.  Bosse seems also to have been active as a painter, though few of his paintings have been identified.",1,1602 – 1676,/m/032jjq,18049155,630516,,,Abraham Bosse,,0,0,5036,500031187,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049155/,60756,61542289,681834,

"Jacques-François Blondel was the father of Georges-François Blondel (ca. 1730-ca. 1790), draughtsman and engraver, and Jean-Baptiste Blondel (1764-1825), architect. He first studied architecture with Jean-François Blondel and later with Gilles Marie Oppenord. He was elected at the Académie royale d'architecture in 1754 or 1755. In 1739 or 1746, Blondel founded his own school of architecture. In 1756 or 1762 he was named professor at the Académie Royale d'Architecture, thus ending his own school.

excelled at architecture and landscape subjects. He studied first with his father,
Jakob Alt, and received formal training from 1825 to 1832 at the Akademie der
Bildenden Künste, Vienna, where he was later a member. In 1832, his work earned
him a prize, which freed him from military service and allowed him to devote himself fully to art. 

Like his brother, Alt traveled extensively, visiting areas of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and, beginning as early as 1834, exhibited works he had made during these trips in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Dresden, and Paris. He was commissioned by Czar Alexander II in 1863 to execute views of the imperial residences in the Crimea. The Lanckoronski watercolors are two of a series of ten completed for a commission by Count Karol Lanckoronski (1848–1933) of his residence prior to the construction of the Palais Lanckoronski in 1894–95.

noble family forced into exile during the political upheavals of the nineteenth century. A friend of Charles de Talleyrand, Fredro would have been about sixteen
years old in 1836 when A Room in the Reuss Palace, Dresden was completed. Another drawing in the Thaw Collection, A Room in a Florentine Palace, came from an album which may have been assembled by Fredro’s sister and originally contained a number of his drawings.

founding member in 1804 of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Evidence of
this tutelage is apparent in Hunt’s early landscapes, genre scenes, and architectural studies. In 1806, Hunt showed at the Royal Academy and enrolled for formal study the following year. Early in his career, he found employment by painting views of gentleman’s country seats, of which the Cassiobury drawing is one example. Hunt worked primarily in watercolor and first exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1814, joining as a full member in 1826.

"Trude Guermonprez started weaving in Halle, Germany at the Municipal School of Arts and Crafts. Her family emigrated to the United States in 1939. After war, Trude did freelance work in Holland, where her husband, photographer Paul Guermonprez, was killed while serving in the Dutch Underground. Six years of weaving in a Dutch rug shop preceded her coming to America, at the invitation of Anni Albers, to teach at Black Mountain College, and later to northern California to join her friend, Marguerite Wildenhain, at Pond Farm Workshops in a producing-teaching cooperative in Guerneville.Then, she moved to San Francisco with her new husband, the craftsman-builder John Elsesser, and worked there becoming Chairman of the Craft Department at The California College of Arts and Crafts. In Studio One at the Oakland College she helped young people approach her artistry.Though she has designed fabrics for New York textile manufacturers, her works were mainly custom produced for architects and individuals.
Speaking of her own work, ""I feel that wall hangings don't have to be as demanding or as provocative as paintings...they can just be something on which to rest and refresh the eye...to give a pleasant feeling to a wall"".",114,"American, b.

"Edward Mcnight Kauffer was born in Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana on 14 December 1890. He grew up in the small town of Evansville on the Ohio River in Indiana, where the Kauffer grandparents had settled. After the divorce of their parents, he spent two years in an orphanage. By the age of four or five he had begun to draw. His mother remarried in 1899. Kauffer left school at the age of 12 or 13 to be helper to the scene painter in the City Directory. In the Elder Bookshop and Art Rooms in San Francisco Kauffer acquired not only a speaking voice of marked attractiveness and distinction but also a life-long passion for books. He continued his studies as a painter by receiving his first formal training at evening sessions at the Mark Hopkins Institute. He met Professor McKnight, who became his patron; in homage to him Kauffer adopted the name of McKnight. A small exhibition of Kauffer's paintings was held at the Elder Art Rooms. From 1912 to 1913 he was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. Kauffer reached Paris in the autumn of 1913. On July 1914 he married an American concert pianist, Grace Ehrlich, and together, they left for England. Kauffer had tried over 25 London companies unsuccessfully when he met Frank Pick, the Publicity Manager of the London Underground Electric Railways. The first posters for the London Underground Railways appeared in 1915. Over the next 25 years the company became his major client and he their major posters artist. During the five years period 1916-1921 Kauffer was an increasingly exhibited painter who seemed to be at home with all of the different, and sometimes warring, elements of the English avant-garde, but he was also an increasingly successful designer. A more interesting commission for which Kauffer produced designs throughout this period was initiated by the Manchester textile company Steinthal & Company A.P. Simon.
Kauffer regularly provided posters, sets and costumes for the Art League of Service, founded in London in 1919. He's career as a painter finished in 1920 with his resignation from the London Group, the failure of X Group. In 1921 he was sufficiently in funds to attempt to establish himself as a designer in New York. He returned to London in the spring of 1922. On his return Kauffer resumed work on a set of posters commissioned by Pick to advertise the principal museums in London. Others clients in this period were Gerald Meynell and Cyril Eastman. It was probably a useful step for Kauffer to join Sir William Crawford's agency, which was alive to continental developments in graphic design.
In the thirties Kauffer became a very public figure in Britain. In this period many exhibitions of Kauffer's works were held England.
He worked for Cresta Silk and Orient Line. Peter Gregory was one sheet-anchor for Kauffer in the thirties, Jack Beddington was another and made most of his new opportunities. Kauffer's collaboration with Ninette de Valois and Arthur Bliss to create Checkmate in 1937 was his first and last triumph in the theatre. Kauffer bought a small Regency house in Buckinghamshire, North End, where he occupied himself reading Kierkegaard and Dante and tried his hand at illustrating the ""Inferno"". He showed his work in Chicago, New York and designed for Barnum and Bailey's Circus, the New York Subways Advertising Co Inc., Container Corporation, American Silk Mills, many War Relief  Associations, Alfred Knopf, the Modern Library, Harcourt Brace, Random House, Pantheon Books and other companies. Kauffer began to lose interest in the New York advertising scene. A friend of his said that he chose to kill himself with drink. He continued to work to the end, almost obsessively. Kauffer died on 22 October 1954.",116,"American, active in England, 1890–1954",/m/04ggyzk,18041923,841,,3020,Edward McKnight Kauffer,,0,0,571,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041923/,52840,112110581,18749130,23424977

"Anna Alma-Tadema began her artistic training at a very young age under the tutelage of her father, Dutch-born painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836–1912). Anna was the youngest daughter from her father’s first marriage. After his wife’s death in 1869, Alma-Tadema married one of his pupils, Laura Thèrése Epps, who became a respected artist. Anna Alma-Tadema’s debut seems to have been at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1885, where two studies she submitted were “indicative of much promise” (New York Times, May 17, 1885). Another view of Townshend House in Regent’s Park, London, may have been painted prior to 1885, when Alma-Tadema and his family moved to the house formerly owned by James Tissot in Grove End Road, in St. John’s Wood.

While based in Vienna throughout his life, Alt traveled widely in the Tyrol, northern Italy, and central Europe, making studies of landscapes and picturesque views of local architecture. One of his first albums of watercolors, commissioned by Count Casimir Esterházy, contained views of the northern Italian town Tarvisio and its vicinity.

"Alexandre Benois was a painter, watercolorist, illustrator, and writer best known
for his stage décor and costume designs for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. The
son and grandson of court architects, Benois was brought up within the Russian
imperial entourage. His father worked at Peterhof and later at Pavlovsk, and was
responsible for the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow and the Mariinsky Theatre in St.
Petersburg (Crisp, Clement. ""Alexandre Nikolaevich Benois,"" in Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 13, no. 2, 1995: 47-48). 

Benois first began his study of painting in St. Petersburg between 1887 and 1888, and from 1891 to about 1910 he participated in exhibitions of the Society of Russian Watercolorists. Around 1898, Benois founded the magazine Mir Iskousstva (The World of Art) with Diaghilev and Léon Bakst. In 1909, at the same time he was designing for the Ballets Russes, he exhibited a suite of paintings entitled Promenade de Louis XIV dans le parc de Versailles. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Benois continued to be engaged in the fine arts. He served as director of the Picture Gallery of the Hermitage Museum from 1917 until he left Russia for Paris in 1926.

"Marian Bantjes (b. 1963) began working in the field of visual communication in 1983 and from 1984 to 1994 worked as typesetter.   From 1994 to 2003 she and a partner established the firm Digitopolis that produced materials for corporations, education and arts organizations.  In 2003 she left this firm to create a more personal style combining type and ornament that has allowed her to cross boundaries between fine arts and design, illustration and typography.  Bantjes' highly original approach has brought her international recognition.  Her clients include Saks Fifth Avenue, Penguin Books, Houghton Mifflin, and other designers including Michael Bierut at Pentagram and Stefan Sagmeister, as well as many design magazines such as Print and Wallpaper.  She teaches typography at Emily Carr Institute in Vancouver, Canada.  At a 2010 Ted Talk, Marian Bantjes spoke eloquently about what drives her approach to visual communication.  She said she enjoys figuring out things, using unusual materials, and experimenting with the interdependency of word and image.  But most of all, she searches for the unexpected, incorporating wonder and surprise.  Her characteristic objects use Vector graphics and obsessive hand work and patterning.",6,"Canadian, b. 1963",/m/03c3svm,18060549,,,,Marian Bantjes,,0,0,13446,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060549/,,,13391189,23424775

genre scenes, and miniatures. He was a member of the Society of Painter-Etchers
and of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters. (JGK)",1,"British, 1839 - 1921",,18060515,,,,Henry Robert Robertson,,0,0,13426,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060515/,3947,18630806,,23424975
"Mary Ellen Best was born in York, England, the younger of two daughters of
well-to-do doctor Charles Best and his wife Mary. Her father died when she was
eight, and left a bequest to both children, guaranteeing in some measure their freedom to pursue an education and not be forced into marriage for financial support as adults. 

Mary Ellen and her sister Rosamond attended boarding school and were both likely taught painting privately prior to their lessons with George Haugh (1755–1827), a successful painter who exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy (Davidson, Caroline. The World of Mary Ellen Best. London: Chatto & Windus, 1985: 16). Best lived with her mother after her schooling, and they often traveled together through England, Germany, and the Netherlands. Family documents indicate that Mary Ellen was actively painting watercolors and selling her works as early as 1831. After the 1850s, she seems to have given up painting. She recorded her career by pasting a number of her best paintings chronologically into albums; nearly all of these albums have now been dispersed.

"Edward Lamson Henry was born in Charleston, South Carolina; at the age of
seven, he was brought to live with relatives in New York. He began studying art
at fourteen with Walter Oddie (1808–1865), a landscape painter and early
member of the National Academy of Design. Henry furthered his study with Paul
Weber (1823–1916) at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and in Paris as a
student of Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797–1890) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
He later traveled through Rome and Florence. In 1859, Henry began exhibiting
yearly at the National Academy of Design; two years later he received the status of
full Academician. From 1875 to 1879, Henry lived in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy and Suffolk Street Gallery, and exhibited at both the 1878 and 1889 Expositions Universelles, receiving an honorable mention for his submission to the latter. After returning to the United States, he spent summers in a small artist/farming community in upstate New York known as Cragsmoor, which frequently appeared as the subject of his landscape and genre paintings from the late 1870s onward.

"Ladislav Sutnar , bohemian painter and advertising, display, and industrial designer. 
He studied at the School of Industrial Arts and at the Technical University and at the Charles University in Prague. 
At the early age of 26 Sutnar became a professor of design at the State School for Graphic Arts, also in Prague.
A pioneering designer, he worked as a painter and stage designer, becoming one of the most notable exhibition designers of the 1930s. His most important designs included 1930-1932 glass drinking set, 1928-1932 china table set, and cutlery. In 1930 Sutnar produced designs for porcelains dinnerware and, in 1931, heat-resistant cups, tea sets, and containers for Schone Stube in Prague. 
As the exhibition architect of the Czechoslovak government, he was chief designer of the Czechoslovak Hall at the Czech pavilion at the 1939-40 ""New York World's Fair"". Arriving in the United States in 1939, he embarked upon a prolific career comprising typography, packaging, and advertising and exhibition design.
In 1941 he became art director, coordinator and designer of the format of ""Sweet's Files"", a set of annually updated catalogues of industrial and architectural products. Sutnar showed designers how to cope with complex information, using visual articulation of type - underlining, type-size and weight contrast, spacing, color, and reversing - to facilitate searching, scanning, and reading.
Since 1951 he had his own company known as ""Sutnar-Office"", which was located on East 37th Street for many years; in recent years it was located on East 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York City and in Cincinnati.
Sutnar was also art director of Theatre Arts Magazine. He also wrote articles and published a numbers of books, among them are: ""Design for Point of Sale"" (1952), ""Package Design: The Force of Visual Selling"" (1953), and ""Visual Design in Action: Principles, Purposes"" (1961). At the same time Sutnar did not neglet his painting, starting a long series of his  famous Venuses, prototypes of American woman in various moods and situations, always happy, tasteful and humorous.
Sutnar won a gold medal at the 1929-30 ""Exposition Internacional de Barcelona"", grand prize at the 1936 (VI) ""Triennale di Milano"", and 14 grand prizes and gold medals at the 1937 ""Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne"". He was elected an honorary member of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America in 1970.
During the last years of his life Sutnar struggled often with financial problems. He died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City , November 18th, 1976.

Ladislav Sutnar (1897-1976) was one of the foremost designers of information graphics, and an accomplished author and designer who wrote about and demonstrated the new corporate requirements for “strength in visual unity”. He developed graphic systems for a variety of businesses clarifying vast amounts of complex information using sometimes little more than common punctuation and lower-case sans serif type.  

Born in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia he studied at the Prague School of Decorative Arts and Czech Technical University. In 1923 he became professor of design at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, ultimately becoming director in 1932, and kept this title even after emigrating to the United States in 1939. Between 1941 and 1960 he was the art director for F.W. Dodge’s Sweet’s Catalog Service, America’s leading distributor and producer of trade and manufacturing catalogues, for which he created a “navigational” system using icons and typographical devices that allowed users to review quantities of information quite easily. In 1951 he opened his own office in New York and had clients such as Bell System, for whom he designed the parentheses that enclose the area code, and he also worked for Vera scarves and Addo-x Inc., a Swedish business machine company that was competing with Olivetti in the United States. It is for the latter company that Sutnar designed exhibitions and created a bold graphic identity demonstrating his special capacity for the design of graphic symbols.",67,"American, b.

"Engraver, etcher, printmaker and publisher, son of (1) Theodor de Bry. He was the most prolific printmaker of the family, practising both engraving and etching. With his father and his brother Johann Israel, he published two popular emblem books: Emblemata nobilitate et vulgo scitu digna (Frankfurt am Main, 1593; Paris, 1895) and Emblemata secularia (Oppenheim, 1611). With his brother he also published the design of a grotesque and quasi-erotic human alphabet (Hollstein, nos 119–69). His independent work includes reproductive engravings after such masters as Titian, Marten de Vos, Abraham Bloemaert and Sebald Beham.

"Verner Panton was born in Denmark in 1926, he studied at the Technical College from 1944-47, and then studied architecture at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen from 1947-1951. Panton lived and worked most of his life in Basel, Switzerland, where by the mid-1950s he was an internationally acclaimed interior architect and designer. His most decisive influence was the Danish designer Poul Henningsen who was known for his lighting design and key figure in 20th century Danish design, and who became Panton’s mentor. He also admired the work of Arne Jacobsen, and worked in his office form 1950-52. At this time Jacobsen was one of Denmark’s leading architects, and though he built relatively few buildings, Panton referred to himself as both an architect and designer. 

Panton loved to experiment with his work. Some of his greatest designs came from toying with different materials, production techniques, traditional design, as well as manipulating light and color. Color is one of Panton’s trademarks, as well as the central element of his design. He studied the physics of light and published a booklet, Notes of Colour, in 1997. He was constantly searching for innovations in all areas of design. He started to create rooms as environments in 1960 beginning with a hotel and restaurant in Trondheim, Norway. He reached his pinnacle in 1970 with the legendary Visiona 2 exhibition in Cologne, which was commissioned by the Bayer chemical company. Panton’s comprehensive approach to design as well as the design of radical environments was then emulated by designers like Pierre Paulin and Joe Colombo. 

As mentioned, color  was a central element in all of Verner Panton’s designs for interiors and furniture, and in particular, textiles, which became his most important vehicle for color in the futurist environments for which Panton is best known. When Panton left Jacobsen’s office in 1952, he traveled throughout Europe introducing designs for chairs, lighting, and textiles to a number of companies and obtaining commissions mainly for Danish projects. In 1968 Panton was commissioned by the paint and fiber manufacturer, Bayer, to design an environment at the Cologne Furniture Fair using synthetic fibers and materials.  Intended as an annual series of exhibitions to take place on a boat, Panton advised Bayer to call it Visiona. For Visiona 0 in 1968, the futurist environment was referred to as the Dralon Boat, and included furniture, lighting, and textiles, a combination which caused a visually interesting and an almost dizzying effect. 

The Anatomical Designs, which included Lippen, were initially part of Visiona 0 from 1968. Round rooms of various colors were bedecked with draperies and round floor carpets on which were printed large photorealist representations of hands, feet, mouths, eyes and ears. The model for these body parts was his wife, Marianne. Later, the Swiss textile company, Mira-X, produced these designs under the name of Anatomic. The Visiona series continued until the mid-1970s under Panton’s leadership and featured such illustrious designers as Joe Colombo.  However, it soon featured only home textiles rather than presenting Panton’s idea of a model living environment, where every new technical innovation in the field of synthetic materials was put to use.  


Panton began a long-term collaboration with the Swiss textile manufacturer, Mira-X, in 1969.  Panton’s collections for Mira-X were based on his idea of an integral concept of living, and a vision of colored space. Many of these textiles also represented Panton’s love for experimentation with form, material, and production techniques.  Every fabric was a variation on the initial collection, which was based on a limited number of geometric patterns and only eight pure colors with additional tonal variations. The number of colors and patterns grew over time, but by the 1980s Mira-X ceased to manufacture Panton textiles, and the interest in his work waned. 

In addition to textiles, the Cooper-Hewitt currently has the stacking side chair (1977-1-1) and Cone chair (1986-99-44) by Panton. Lippen represents some of his strongest work designed at the pinnacle of his career, and since it is an earlier textile design, is more in keeping with the 1959-60 design of the chairs. The Cooper-Hewitt also has in its collection seven textiles from 1983 produced by Mira-X, which one of his more innovative and unusual fabrics produced during the early 1970s, Finesse: Circle (2011-36-2), a printed textile with areas of burn out within the circles. This created a semi-translucent textile that when held up to the light would have created a very dappled light and feeling of three-dimensionality. Finesse designs also included Square and Curve.",7,"Danish, 1926–1998",/m/02gc67,18045471,,,4485,Verner Panton,,0,0,2623,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045471/,31520,116681603,487018,

"In 1877, at the age of 26, Doat joined the National Manufactory of Sevres.  His speciality was pate-sur-pate decoration and flambe, crystalline and metallic glazes. Doat also wrote the ceramic textbook, Grand Feu Ceramics, that was translated into English by Samuel Robineau.  In 1909, he arrived in the U.S. to work as the Director of the School of Ceramic Art at the Art Institute and the University City Pottery in Missouri.  Under his guidance, University City Pottery  flourished.  University City Pottery work was exhibited at the International Exposition of 1911 in Turin, Italy where it was awarded the Grand Prize in competition with all the European potteries.  After a reorganization of  University City Pottery in 1912, Doat stayed on as director.  Production at University City Pottery ended by early 1915.  Doat returned to France in 1915 and died there in May 1938.

"Born in Paris and woked in Rome from about 1845 to 1898.  He was most well-known for his jewelry in the Etruscan style.  
""Pierret is first recorded as a working jeweller, of 55 via Borgogna, though no initial is given, in Murray's Handbook for Central Italy and Rome of 1850.  By the  1853 edition, his address, still with no initial, is given as 31 Piazza di Firenze, with the comment the he is 'now one of the first artists in Rome for Etruscan jewellery, and is more moderate in his charges than Castellani'.  The Libro Per Turri, an artistic and commercial guide to Rome of 1866, records Ernesto Pierret at 36 via dell' Umilta, but the Murray Handbook to Rome of 1867 records Pierret at 20 Piazza di Spagna and describes him as 'only second to Castellani'.  He remained at this address until the late 1890s when he no longer appears in the guidebooks or directories.  At some point prior to 1884, however, the business appears to have been taken over by Luigi Pierret, presumable a son, who exhibited 'archaeological-style' jewellry at the Turin Exhibition of 1884.""

"Established by Elbert Hubbard (1856 - 1915) in 1895, the Roycroft community was located in East Aurora, New York.  An Arts and Crafts community centered around a series of workshops, it employed up to 500 people at its peak. The workshops produced furniture, bookbindings and metalwork. Hubbard was ""an apostle of aestheticism"" and authored books on the relationshiop between the arts and life. Karl Kipp was selected by Hubbard to organize and direct the Roycroft copper shop, and by 1910 the workshop was in full production.  Kipp was assisted in this endeavor by Walter Jennings.  They left to start their own firm, The Tookay Shop, in 1911, but in 1915 were persuaded to return by Elbert Hubbard II, who had succeeded his father after the death of his parents in the Lusitania disaster in 1915.  The wares were originally sold through gift shops and mail order, but Hubbard II decided to establish retail displays in major department stores.  By 1924, there were more than 320 retail outlets nationwide.  The firm's sales were drastically cut due to the Depression, and the Roycroft Shops formally declared bankruptcy in 1938.  Some of the early designs form the shop use motifs which were reminiscent of Viennese Secessionist designs, especially the work of Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser for the Wiener Wekstatte.  These designs were familiar to Dard Hunter, who had travelled to Vienna in 1908, and began incorporating Secessionist designs into his stained glass designs upon his return to the Roycroft community in 1909.  Karl Kipp and Dard Hunter collaborated on some lamps for the 1910 catalog and Hunter's designs probably influenced Kipp's work.

"Graphic and product design, film/video. M & Co. was a graphic and product design consultancy that was founded in 1979 in New York City by Tibor Kalman. Kalman (b.1949), a native of Budapest, immigrated to America with his family in the late 1950s. While in New York, Kalman studied journalism at New York University. His interest in language, words, images, and typography, became the impetus for the creation of his own design firm. M & Co. was known for its innovative use of images and type to create imaginative and witty designs. Many prominent figures in the field got their start with M & Co., including Stephen Doyle, Alexander Isley, Bethany Johns, Marlene McCarty, and Emily Oberman. During its 14-years history, the company worked on a variety of projects from videos and album covers to stationery and ID systems. Clients included Hannibal Records, the Talking Heads, the Memphis real-estate agency, the Restaurant Florent and the China Grill in New York, the National Audubon Society, Benetton, Swatch, and NYNEX. M & Co. created the title sequences for movies including Jonathan Demme's ""Something Wild"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and David Byrne's ""True Stories"". In addition, M & Co., created its own line of products, among them an architectural paperweight made of rigid vinyl and lead, mimicking a crumpled piece of blueprint paper, and a line of timepieces with nontraditional faces. Among their better known timepieces are the ""10-1-4"" watch, whose face has only the numbers 10, 1, and 4, in their appropriate places; the ""Onomatopoeia"" watch, where certain digits are replaced by symbols, such as a  hand representing the number five; the ""Bug"" watch, where numerals were replaced with a variety of insect symbols; and the ""Askew"" watch, whose digits appeared on the face in random order. Kalman identifies his wife Maira, herself a noted artist and children's author, as ""an important collaborator"". Kalman dissolved the company in 1992. At that time he donated the company's administrative and project files to the museum. Kalman moved to Rome in 1993 to edit Benetton'magazine, ""Colors"". Subsequently, he returned to New York to work independently.",312,1979–1993,,18048717,,,,M & Co.,,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048717/,,,,23424977

"Thomas Lamb was an industrial designer who gained the most notoriety for his design of physiologically efficient handles. From an early age he was interested in anatomy and physiology, and wanted to become a doctor. However, financial difficulties forced him to drop out of high school and he began work in a textile design shop. During this time he studied at the Art Students League, and finally at seventeen, Lamb opened his own textile design studio. His designs for home goods became very popular during the 1920s and were sold in major New York City department stores. He also created illustrations for books and magazines such as “Good Housekeeping"" magazine, which spurred even more designs. After World War II, Lamb turned his attention to the war effort. While at first he was designing items like “Victory napkins,” he soon turned his attention to the needs of veterans. This shift eventually led to the more ergonomic and functional work with handles. This is the work that gained him the most notoriety, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948. During his long career Lamb worked with a great deal of retailers, manufactures and stores, and created a large breadth of designs for a wide range of media and products.

"The Deerfield Society of Blue and White Neddlework was founded in Deerfield, Massachusets in 1896 and closed in 1926.  The founders were Margaret Whiting (1869 - 1946) and Ellen Miller (1854 - 1929).  All work was made in the town.
The original intention of the society was to reproduce the look of eighteenth century colonial embroideries using only blue and white yarns.  Early on the Deerfield work was exhibitied frequently at Arts and Crafts exhibitions.  Numerous referenes to the work of the society appeared in the contemporary press (House Beautiful, American Homes and Gardens, Mordern Priscilla, Handicrafts, etc.) and Deerfield was always described as the foremost of the village industries which appeared at that time.
Within a few years the Society of Blue and White Needlework was using yarns and fabrics in a wide range of colors for their work.  Members of the society did their own dyeing.  The range of patterns expanded to include contemporary designs.  However, the name remained the same and was in use until the society disbanded in 1926.",17,,,18051617,,,,"Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework (American, 1896–1926)",,0,0,,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051617/,,,,23424977

"Hella Jongerius was born in de Meern, Netherlands in 1963, and graduated from the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven in 1993. In Jongerius’ designs, she often manipulates ancient craft technique and modern technology to yield a product that reflects their ultimate potential. Her early work for Droog Design, the Dutch design collaborative, has been standout in the world of product design for over a decade. At her design firm, Jongeriuslab, materials largely determine the direction of their designs. The range of materials and techniques used at the firm are diverse and very broadly derived. For example, an exploration of polyurethane resulted in Soft Vases (1994), where the form of an antique urn is recast in soft, malleable polyurethane, and, in another project, a primitive wooden African prie-dieu, or prayer desk, is transformed into the Kasese Chair (1999), which couples the elemental nature of felt with futuristic carbon fiber while still preserving the poetry of the original form. Jongerius’ unique approach to design objects, specifically textiles, and her willingness to experiment leads to inspired final products.",12,"Dutch, b. 1963",,18055675,5661,,7584,Hella Jongerius,,0,0,10403,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055675/,4296,79456651,,23424909

"Russel Wright, who was born in Lebanon, Ohio on April 3, 1904 and died in 1976, was one of the most important pioneers in American design, especially in his efforts to revolutionize how people live and relate to their domestic environment. As Donald Albrecht wrote in his 2001 exhibition Russel Wright  Creating American Lifestyle, Wright’s “inexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative but were also the tools to achieve his concept of ‘easier living’, a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal.” The Cooper-Hewitt has over one hundred works in the collection by Wright, from a design drawing for flatware to extensive examples from his American Modern line of tableware and serving accessories.",90,"American, 1904 – 1976",/m/0cf_5k,18043357,601110,,6460,Russel Wright,,0,0,1346,500001139,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043357/,1241,120170791,4661570,23424977

"Ruth Reeves was a textile designer who was an associate and friend to many designers such as Donal Deskey and Henry Varnum Poor.  She participated in the first American Designer's Gallery exhibtion in 1929.  In 1932 she collaborated on the decoration of Radio City Music Hall and produced carpet designs for the project (an example of her carpet for the Grand Foyer of Radio City Music Hall is in the CHNDM collection 1987-69-1).
In 1934 Ruth Reeves studied the native textile and costume production in Guatemala and upon her return to New York produced an exhibtion held in the R.C.A. Building in 1935.

"Born in Czechoslovakia, Mucha received his first formal training at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich from 1885-1887.  His patron Count Karl Khuen-Belassi, then sent him to Paris where he worked as a magazine and book illustrator.   Mucha established his reputation as an innovative designer with a series of nine lithograph posters commissioned by the actress Sarah Bernhardt along with two posters for Job cigarettes (1896 and 1898).  In these works Mucha created a unique style depicting exotic, sensuous women with long tangled hair together with densely-packed Byzantine and Moravian folk art motifs and stylized plants and flowers.   While textile designs were not a major part of his graphic production, Mucha did produce a number of designs for printed fabrics between 1897 and 1898.  All the designs were handled by the Paris firm of C.G. Forrer who sent them to an Alsatian printing firm, Sheurer, Lauth & Cie, and a London firm for manufacture. In addition to posters and textile designs Mucha executed designs for wallpaper, furniture, metalwork, flatware, glassware, lace and ornament all published in Documents Decorative par A.M. Mucha, Paris:  Librarie Central des Beaux-Arts, 1901).  Mucha was actively involved with the Paris 1900 Exposition Universelle, designing jewelry and a shop for Georges Fouquet.  In 1910 he returned to Bohemia where he executed a series of twenty paintings for the city of Prague in 1928.",3,"b. Ivancice, Moravia 1860 – 1939 d.

"Alexander Girard (1907-93) was one of the leading American designers during the mid-twentieth century and was a strong proponent, along with his colleagues Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames, Kevin Roche and George Nelson, for bringing an affordable modernism to the middle class. The designs that resulted from these collaborations now define 1950s and 60s modernism in America. Educated as an architect at the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal School of Architecture in Rome, he came to the United States in 1932 to set up an architecture and interior design office in New York. Girard was the head of the Textile Division of Herman Miller Inc. from 1952 to 1973. During this time, Girard created over three hundred designs for textiles coordinated for use as upholstery fabrics, draperies and casement goods for private and commercial interiors, exhibitions and corporate identity programs. His exuberant use of color, texture and pattern drew from folk art and Op art influences, synthesized into a unique style which became “the look” of 1960s America. Ultimately settling in Santa Fe, New Mexico he continued to practice as a “designer” in the all-inclusive sense of the word, by designing residences, exhibitions, company identities and textiles throughout the duration of his career.",1391,"(American, 1907 – 1993)",,18046041,692846,,,Alexander Hayden Girard,,0,0,2933,500096402,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046041/,,27870229,7474087,23424977

"University City Pottery was a division of the Art Institute at University City in Missouri.  It was promoted by Edward Garner Lewis who began the American Woman's League in 1907, whose purpose was to develop ""the integrity and purity of the American home, with wider opportunity for American women.""  The Art Institute was more developed than the other schools of education, language, commerce, administration, journalism and photography.  The Art Insitute had a prestigious faculty:  George Julian Zolnay, the sculptor, was Dean and Director; John H. Vanderpoel, Director of the School of Painting; Antoinette P. Taylor, instructor of metal and leather work; Mrs. Prudence Stokes Brown, instructor of elementary handiwork; Taxile Doat, Director of the School of Ceramic Art.  
Working with Taxile Doat in ceramics: Frederick Hurten Rhead of Rhead Pottery, instructor of pottery; Mrs. Adelaide Alsop Robineau of Robineau Pottery; Mrs. Kathryn E. Cherry, Instructor of China Painting and Ceramic Design; Edward Dahlquist of Shawsheen Pottery, instructor of built pottery; Frank J. Fuhrmann, instructor of throwing and turning pottery; Eugene Labarriere and Emile Diffloth both associates of Doat's from Europe.   
The experiments of this knowledgeable group proved that native United States clays were superior to the finest of Europe and were more widely available.  The Grand Prize awarded to the University City Pottery in Turin, Italy, at the International Exposition in 1911 further emphasized that this American pottery could compete with the best of Europe.  The pottery was noted for its superior bodies, matt and gloss glazes, colored and colorless, all of the matt greens of various textures, alligator skin, crystalline, Oriental crackle, and a matt white.  These were accomplished by glazes with the coloring oxides thoroughly incorporated and then fired at the same temperature as the body. 
Frederick Hurten Rhead and Mr. and Mrs. Robineau left the pottery in 1911, as well as the break up of the American Women's League occurred at this time.  After a reorganization under Doat, in 1912, the pottery continued to produce excellent work with the ending of production by early 1915.

"Edward Bawden was a watercolorist, book illustrator, mural painter and designer. In 1925, Bawden saw William Morris's wallpaper ""Daisy"" in an exhibition and was inspired to design his first wallpaper. Harold Curwen saw some of these early designs and wanted to transfer the pieces to his lithographic press so they could be reproduced  and sold. Bawden designed 14 wallpapers between 1926 and 1933 for the Curwen Press.
